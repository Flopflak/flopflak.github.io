        <h2>Welcome to my digital corner! I'm Flopflak.</h2>
        <p>Primarily, I find myself engrossed in academic pursuits as a student. However, whenever the world of academia grants me a reprieve, I delve into the intricate realms of programming. Over time, I've acquainted myself with a spectrum of languages - Python and C# being my fortes. I've also dabbled in the basics of C and Assembly. Of them all, Python feels most like home; it's where I craft most of my digital wonders.</p>
        
        <p>If you ever feel the inclination to delve into collaborative endeavors, share feedback on my projects, or merely indulge in a tech-centric chat, I'm all ears (or eyes, in the case of digital communication!). Here's where you can reach out:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p>Between the academic hustle and coding endeavors, my virtual footprints have led to the creation of some intriguing projects, notably Surveyer and PrivateOffice. While I've ceased the updates for Surveyer, believing it has reached its zenith, PrivateOffice might see some innovative enhancements in the future. Time and inspiration will decide that trajectory!</p>
        
        <p>If your curiosity has been piqued and you wish to delve deeper into the codes and constructs I've been working on, my <a href="https://github.com/flopflak" target="_blank">Github Profile</a> is but a click away.
